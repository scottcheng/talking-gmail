Sit back, listen.

Talking Gmail adds a "read this message" menu button to your Gmail™ and reads the entire message with one click. No more struggling with reading lengthy emails with exhausted eyes.

Features:

* Read entire Gmail message with one click.
* Highlight the paragraph you are currently listening to.
* Pause / resume / stop / previous / next with Talking Gmail controller.

Note: Talking Gmail should work fine with textual emails, but is not expected to work well with fancy advertising ones.

Privacy: Talking Gmail does *not* record any personal information from your Gmail.
